Pong---
This is a project I made as an example for a C++ class that I taught. My project essentially implements a more advanced version of pong
with powerups and paddle rotation. The project is written in C++ and uses the SFML graphics library. I've included this project mainly 
to show code organization and proficiency in C++. In order to actually run the code, you would need to have the SFML graphics library
installed and linked. Main function can be found in Pong/SourceFiles/Main.cpp.
